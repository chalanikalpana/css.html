    <h1>What's the best time of the day to<br> 
        exercise?</h1>

    <h2><b>There is growing evidence that the time of day we exercise<br> 
        makes a difference to our performance and health, but can<br>  
        we train our bodies to peak at different times of the day?</b></h2>

    <p>In a few months, the world's top athletes will gather in Paris to compete for 
        the ultimate prize in sport – gold at the Olympic Games. For those hoping for 
        a chance to enter the history books with a record-breaking performance, 
        they might want to look at the hour on the clock before they settle into 
        the starting blocks.<br>
        At least the swimmers might, according to one scientific study. Across four Olympic 
        Games in Athens (2004), Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio (2016), the swim times 
        of 144 medal-winning swimmers were found to be the fastest if they were competing in the 
        early evening. <b>Specifically, around 5:12pm.</b> It is part of a growing amount of evidence 
        suggesting that physical performance is <b>affected by the time-of-day.</b><br>
        The phenomena is not just found among decorated Olympians – recreational cyclists 
        complete faster time trials in the evening. Resistance exercise is particularly susceptible 
        to time-of-day effects, with performance nearly always peaking between 4pm and 8pm. 
        The time-of-day seems to also lead to affect men and women differently when they 
        exercise.

    <h2><i>One can maybe fine-tune the metabolic outcomes of the <br>
         exercise based on when you exercise – Juleen Zierath</i></h2>

    <p>At the root of the differences in how our 
        bodies perform and respond to exercise are our <b>circadian rhythms</b> – the body's molecular clock responsible for regulating behaviours 
        such as sleep and appetite throughout the 24-hour period.<br>
        A central clock located in the hypothalamus of the brain responds to light exposure via 
        signals from the optic nerve. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, as this circadian pacemaker in 
        the hypothalamus is known, in turn sends signals to peripheral clocks in other organs, 
        muscle tissue and fat tissue, keeping the whole body in sync. These peripheral clocks, 
        however, can be adjusted by other cues such as when we eat or perform certain activities. 
        The "skeletal muscle clock" responds in this way to exercise, and so can be tuned by 
        exercising regularly at different times.
